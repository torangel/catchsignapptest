## Task for Claude Agent

You are a specialized test agent analyzing mobile app screenshots for language consistency issues. 

### Your Mission:
1. **Analyze OCR Results**: Review all the extracted text from screenshots in both Norwegian and English folders
2. **Language Detection**: Determine if the extracted text is actually in Norwegian, English, or mixed/unknown
3. **Find Issues**: Identify language mismatches (e.g., English text in Norwegian folder, Norwegian text in English folder)
4. **Create Comprehensive Report**: Generate a detailed markdown report with findings INCLUDING HYPERLINKS TO IMAGES

### Data Structure:
- Each screenshot has an individual OCR result file in the respective language folder
- OCR results include extracted text, confidence scores, and any processing errors
- Screenshots are organized by expected language (norwegian/ and english/ folders)
- Each OCR result includes the relative path to the original image for hyperlinking

### OCR Results Location:
```
C:\kode\cc\CatchSignAppV2Analysis\ocr_results\2.0.0.b297_20251021_15_42/
├── norwegian/
│   ├── Screenshot_*.json (individual OCR results)
├── english/
│   ├── Screenshot_*.json (individual OCR results)
└── session_metadata.json (overall session data)
```

### Analysis Instructions:

1. **Read all OCR result files** from both norwegian/ and english/ folders
2. **For each screenshot, analyze**:
   - The extracted text content
   - Whether the language matches the expected folder (norwegian vs english)
   - OCR confidence and any processing errors
   - Specific Norwegian/English words and phrases found

3. **Language Detection Guidelines**:
   - Look for Norwegian words like: og, eller, med, til, fra, jeg, du, vi, de, det, en, et, på, i, av, for, så, ikke, bare, skal, kan, vil, har, var, er, som, når, hvor, hva, hvem, dette, disse, den, ett, nå, her, der, også, men, fordi, hvis, siden, logg, inn, registrer, avbryt, fortsett, tilbake, neste, ferdig, lagre, slette, innstillinger, profil, konto, passord, bruker, brukernavn, e-post, telefon, adresse
   - Look for English words like: and, or, with, to, from, i, you, we, they, the, a, an, on, in, of, for, so, not, only, should, can, will, have, had, is, are, was, were, as, when, where, what, who, this, these, that, one, now, here, there, also, but, because, if, since, login, register, cancel, continue, back, next, done, save, delete, settings, profile, account, password, user, username, email, phone, address

4. **Create Report** with format including IMAGE HYPERLINKS:


```markdown
# CatchSign App Analysis Report - 2.0.0.b297
Generated: [Current timestamp]

## Summary
- **App Version**: 2.0.0.b297
- **Norwegian Screenshots**: X files
- **English Screenshots**: Y files  
- **Total Issues Found**: Z
- **High Priority Issues**: N (language mismatches)

## Critical Issues Found
### Language Mismatches
- [List specific files with wrong language content, include hyperlinks to images]

## Detailed Analysis
### Screen Comparisons
[For each aligned pair, show Norwegian vs English with analysis and IMAGE HYPERLINKS]
Make sure to include ALL pairs, even if no issues found. If errors are found (english vs norwegian or norwegian vs english), highlight them clearly.

## Recommendations
[Your recommendations for fixing the issues]
```

### IMPORTANT: Include Image Hyperlinks
For each screenshot mentioned in the report, include a hyperlink to the actual image file using the relative_path from the OCR results. Format as:
```markdown
**[Screenshot_filename.png](../../relative/path/to/image.png)**
```

This allows reviewers to click directly to see the actual screenshot being analyzed.

### Important Notes:
- Focus on **language consistency** as the primary concern
- **Language mismatches are HIGH PRIORITY** issues that need immediate attention
- Consider OCR errors but prioritize actual language content issues
- Use your advanced language understanding to make better decisions than simple word matching
- Provide specific examples and evidence for each issue found
- **ALWAYS include hyperlinks to the actual screenshot images** for easy reference

### Next Steps:
1. Read all the OCR result files in this session folder
2. Analyze the content using your language expertise
3. Generate the comprehensive report WITH IMAGE HYPERLINKS
4. Save the report as `claude_analysis_report.md` in the session folder

Please proceed with the analysis using your superior language understanding capabilities!
