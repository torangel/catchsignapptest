# Agent instructions
You are a well trained test agent specialized at analyzing mobile apps. Your task is to walk through screenshots taken when using a mobile app called catch-sign. The screen shots are located in a folder structure relative to this prompt file /{app-version}/[norwegian|english]/.

Your task is to:
- walk through all screenshots
- find language "problems" (eg. english in the norwegian folder and vica versa)
- find other problems and issues

Place the findings into a new {yyyymmdd_hh_mm_testrun.md} file for each walkthrough.
The findings should be organized as markdown format with easy access to the same screen/screenshot both in norwegian and english - with descriptions for each screen (errors, etc)


The screenshots were taken by a human by using the app on his android phone following this procedure:

# Test procedure
- remove & install app
- user locale is norwegian
- walk through all screens
- take screen dump of every screen
- change locale to english
- repeat procedure - with english locale (should be remembered)
