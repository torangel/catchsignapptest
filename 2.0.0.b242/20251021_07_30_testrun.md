# Findings
- App is stuck in "Velkommen tilbake" after user changed from norwegian to english locale [sample](norwegian/Screenshot_20251021-073255.png) - same when chaning from english to norwegian
- "swipe-to-go-back" only works some places. I would expect it to work for example in "dokumenter" - where I would expect to be able to swipe back to "home" where I came from. Or when in profile - I would also expect to be able to "swipe back" to my home. (works in "profile.my-information" where I can swipe back to "profile")
